# Exercise 1:
# Print all even numbers from 1 to 20.
# Expected Result: 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20

# The thinking behind the solution:
# I create a loop with a range of numbers from 1 to 20. I divide all of them by 2.
# The numbers that, when divided by 2, have a remainder of 0, get printed out as the solution to the exercise.

# Exercise 2:
# Calculate the factorial of the number 5.
# Expected Result: 120

# The thinking behind the solution:
# I create a range from 1 to 5. I then declare a variable "x" that contains the
# result of the multiplication between each number in turn and every number before it in the range.
# I then print "x" to get the result.

# Exercise 3:
# Print the elements of a list in reverse order -> List: [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
# Expected Result: 50 40 30 20 10

# The thinking behind the solution:
# I create a list containing the numbers mentioned. I create a second list that
# will contain the same numbers but in reverse order. I make a loop that goes through each element of the original
# list and inserts it in the second list. I then print the second list.

# Exercise 4:
# Print a pattern of stars in a right triangle format with 5 rows.
# Expected Result:

#     *****

# The thinking behind the solution:
# I create a range between 1 and 5. I multiply every element in the range with the string: "*"
# and store the result in the "result" variable. I print out the variable.

# Exercise 5:
# Sum all the numbers in a list -> List: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# Expected Result: 15

# The thinking behind the solution:

# number in the list to the variable's initial value of 0.

# Exercise 6:

# The thinking behind the solutions:
# Solution 1: I declare a variable with the value of 7. I create a loop with a range from 1 to 10. I then declare
              #  a variable inside the loop by which I multiply the number in the initial variable by every number
              #  in the range. Lastly, I print out an f string containing 7 as a string and the two variables.
# Solution 2: I create a loop containing a list (as opposed to a range). I then create a variable inside the loop
              # through which I multiply every list item by 7. Lastly, I print out an f string containing 7 as a
              # string and the two variables.

# Use a break statement inside a loop
