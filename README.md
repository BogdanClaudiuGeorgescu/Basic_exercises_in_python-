The Basic Python Repository

This repository is meant to contain simple exercises that help me learn the fundamental concepts in Python.

What does this repo contain?
- exercises for Python basic concepts: for loops, etc.
- games created with a mix of concepts: while loops, if-else statements, variables, random numbers
