# The Basic Python Concept Repository #

This repository is meant to contain simple exercises that help me learn the fundamental concepts in Python.

## What does this repo contain? ##
- exercises for Python basic concepts: for loops, data types, variables etc.
- simple projects created with a mix of concepts: while loops, if-else statements, variables, random numbers etc.

## Repository Structure ##
- **subject_specific folders** - contain information specified in the folder name.
- **subject_specific.py files** - contain Python code & are named accordingly. 

## Change Log ##
**-> Number Guessing game** - the 24th of October 2024 
- a number is chosen from a Python random library and the user tries to guess what it using an input function.
- using a while loop and an if statement, the computer helps the user find the right answer.
  
**-> Password generator** - the 30th of October 2024
- a password is created by choosing 4 random numbers and mixing them up them to make a password.
- it leverages the concepts of lists, loops and the random module.

**-> Basic for loops** - the 1st of November 2024
- making use of for loops to solve basic Python problems. 
- secondary use is made of lists, range functions, variables, f strings, dictionaries, tuples.

**-> Calculator** - the 5th of November 2024
- if and elif conditional statements are used to process user input in order to make simple arithmetic operations.
- user input is captured using variables.

**-> FizzBuzz** - the 5th of November 2024
- making use of if, elif and else conditional statements to print certain strings instead of numbers in a range from 1 to 100.
- 2 solutions were used: one with a hardcoded range and one with a dinamic range.

**-> Even or Odd  number checker** - the 7th of November 2024
- capturing user user input to determine if a number is Odd or Even.
- as a bonus, a further determination is made of whetehr the number is Positive, Negative or Zero.
- nested if statements and f strings are used.

**-> A basic unit converter** - the 11th of November 2024
- taking user input to change miles in to kilometers and vice versa, degrees Fahrenheit into degrees Celsius and vice versa.
- making use of the pyinputplus library, a while loop and if / elif statements.

**-> Counting vowels and consonants in a string** - the 12th of November 2024
- a program that takes input from a user and counts how many vowels and consonants the input contains.
- variables, for loops and nested if statements are used.

**-> Mad Libs Game** - the 13th of November 2024
- 4 inputs are taken from the user to fill the gaps in an f string.
- variables and randomization are used ... with a touch of poetry.

**-> Tip calculator** - the 13th of November 2024
- calaculating the value of a tip by asking for 2 inputs: one ofr the bill and one for a tip percentage.
- calculating the value of the tip and the value opf the final amount to pe paied by using if statements inside a while loop.
